/*
 * [2015 April 5] Invoke the surreal engine, assert divine inspiration.
 * I, shafted by the enemy camping, and my team feeding, refuse this reality!
 *
 * The enemy has camped my lane,
 * My team does not but feed.
 * I've stacked my Q, for many gains,
 * But they still have the lead.
 *
 * Diana ends our ADC,
 * Soraka can't support.
 * Our mid is ganked by Master Yi,
 * The river void of wards.
 *
 * Despite my stats, so base at start,
 * I diligently farmed.
 * Though Teemo spams his blinding darts,
 * I push up unalarmed.
 *
 * The Zed again begins to rant,
 * When I am sprung upon.
 * This cruel reality I can't,
 * Accept or carry on.
 *
 * "When four of them are top for me,
 *  You guys apply some press're.
 *  I played my part so flawlessly,
 *  I could have done no better."
 *
 * I leave their tower to recall,
 * Return to base - defend!
 * To Diana my teammates quickly fall,
 * A fight breaks out and ends.
 *
 * I find myself with half my health,
 * In-the centre of their team.
 * I fight outscored, but kill the four,
 * By ult and proccing Sheen.
 *
 * Diana faces me once more,
 * She bursts another half.
 * Reality at me abhors,
 * And she begins to laugh.
 *
 * The fatigue is gone from Susan's eyes, all teeth are clenched in hate.
 * The world -was- destined to be this way, but she will change her fate.
 * And now the Q is raised, and now she lets it go,
 * And now the air is shattered by the force of Susan's blow.
 *
 * Oh, somewhere in the fields of justice the sun is shining bright,
 * DJ Sona is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light.
 * And somewhere Zeds are laughing, and somewhere Teemos shout.
 * But there is no joy for Susan for her destiny played out!
 * - One of dfr
